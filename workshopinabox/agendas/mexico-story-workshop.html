<!-- TITLE AND SUMMARY -->
      <h1>Story Workshop: Greenpeace Mexico</h1>
      <h2>This workshop was an opportunity to help <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/mexico/es/">Greenpeace Mexico</a> work through how they can really bring the story to life. Greenpeace Mexico emerged after 13 months of challenges and changes as a stronger team with an appetite for change. The office put itself forward to pilot new initiatives and were keen to run with the story.</h2>

<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
        
        <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>In terms of the big environmental and social issues that Mexico is facing river pollution, oil, growth, disenfranchisement, reduction of democratic freedom, unrestricted growth and corruption are high up on the agenda.  In terms of priority areas for Greenpeace Mexico the focus is on <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/mexico/es/Campanas/Energia-y-cambio-climatico/">C&E</a>, <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/mexico/es/Campanas/Toxicos/">Toxics</a>, <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/mexico/es/Campanas/Agricultura--sustentable--y-transgenicos/">Food for Life</a>. </p>
<p>There are also many reasons to be hopeful.  60% of the forests are managed by communities and 50% of the lands are social property, sustainable Milpa agriculture is gaining traction and there are plans to make Mexico city sustainable Mexico graduates. This workshop was designed to shine a light on hope and help Greenpeace Mexico show how a billion acts of courage is running through their 3 year strategy. 
</p>

	<h2>Primary Objectives</h2>
	<p>The primary aim of the story workshop is to introduce team Mexico to the new Greenpeace Story and the organisational shifts it implies (The Seven Shifts), and work with the group to help them think about what would mean for a new Greenpeace Mexico. What does a new Greenpeace Mexico look like? How might the story be applied to day to day work, and how it might shape new work like the <a href="http://www.infrastructuremexico.com/2015/10/28/mexico-city-pilot-of-megacities-project/">Megacities campaign</a>?</p>
	<h2>Pre-work for the Workshop</h2>
	<p>We asked participants to think of one example of a story, a trend, an event, or an anecdote that gives them hope that a better world is possible. We asked them to reach beyond Greenpeace's work into things that are either changing, or have the potential to change, the fabric of the world or which are rerouting our future away from the status quo and toward a more beautiful, sustainable, greener, more peaceful world. We explained that we would be running an exercise in which we may ask participants to pitch their example in a ONE MINUTE, lightning-fast presentation of WHAT the example is and WHY it gives you hope. </p>

<!-- REVIEW & ASSESSMENT -->
        <h2>Assessment and review</h2>
        Practical tips for assessing learning:

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use the discussions in each exercise</strong>: Discussion and reflection are important components of learning. Ask questions like:
                            <ul>
                                <li>How can your work connect to the 7 Shifts and living the new story?</li>

                                <li>Why is it important to connect to global communities?</li>

                                <li>How does communication online differ from communication offline?</li>

                                <li>What excited you the most about this training? The least?</li>

								<li>How will we take what we've learned forward?</li>
								<li>What does it mean to live the story? </li> 
								<li>Where can we go for help?</li>
                            </ul>
                            
							<li><strong>Peer Assessment:</strong> Have people look at one another's work and give each other constructive feedback. Hold each other accountable for participation, and encourage open discussion with one another.</li>
							<li><strong>Share</strong>: Have you posted your work somewhere? Did you tweet with the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23courageis&src=typd">#courageis</a> hashtag? Have you attended a <a href="http://wiki.greenpeace.org/Engagement/Community/Calls">Story Community Call</a>?</li>

<!--Preparation-->
<h2>Preparation</h2>

                    <p>You need a large room that can comfortably fit all your participants in a circle. Small break out rooms are a plus.</p>

                    <p>It is also recommended to have a team of co-facilitators who can help shape and run the agenda with you. We recommend 1 facilitator to 5 participants.</p>

<!-- LEARNING OBJECTIVES -->
        <h2>Learning objectives</h2>
         <p>By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>share their learning with fellow Greenpeace peers and wider communities</li>

                        <li>identify the 7 Shifts and explain their individual intentions</li>
                        
                        <li>understand and explain to others how to live the 7 Shifts</li>
                        
                        <li>support Greenpeace in becoming more open</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The participants will understand that:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>they’re part of a global network and community that can help promote local initiatives</li>
                       
                        <li>they’re key ambassadors for Greenpeace, both online and in their communities</li>
                        
                        <li>facilitating and pacing the event is essential to sustaining participant engagement and energy levels</li>

                        <li>we have cultural notions of what learning is <em>supposed</em> to look like</li>

                        <li>modeling behavior we want to see in the world is an integral part of living the new story of Greenpeace</li>

                        <li>we can add the teaching and learning of the 7 Shifts into any campaign or topic</li>

                        <li>working openly means you release early and often to improve your own practice</li>

                        <li>living the new story intermingles social skills, technical skills and topical knowledge</li>
