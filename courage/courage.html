							<h1 id="physical">Physical Courage</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<blockquote>"Hollywood, as everyone knows, glamorises physical courage…if I had to define courage myself, I wouldn’t say it’s about shooting people. I’d say it’s the quality that stimulates people, that enables them to move ahead, and look beyond themselves."<em>– Clint Eastwood, actor/director</em>
							</blockquote>
							<p>This is the courage that probably comes first to mind. It’s the kind that involves physical pain or endurance, where we might risk bodily harm or death to achieve a goal. Hollywood, as one of our principal storytellers in modern culture, abounds with tales of physical courage and mastery over the physical world and all within it. We celebrate the power of physical courage in superhero, action and adventure movies; it garners awe and respect, and tends to be associated with traditional notions of the ‘masculine’. People who display physical courage in our culture are readily called ‘heroes’. Here, the body is the physical boundary between Comfort Zone and what lies outside, and pain is our bodies’ way of telling us in no uncertain terms where our limits are.  In some situations, there are things more important than fear of pain, and our physical fear becomes a border we might attempt to cross for a greater purpose.</p>
<p>
There are a host of expressions of physical courage. The athlete who pushes her physical limits to rise to top of her field, or best herself. The refugee who leaves home behind and enters the sea in a rickety boat with loved ones towards life. The activist standing boldly in the path of a tank in a political or moral act. The soldier who races into a hail of bullets to save a comrade in arms from certain death. The choice to undergo long, hard months of chemotherapy. The child learning to swim, tentatively slipping a toe into the deep end of the pool for the first time. 
Physical courage undeniably reminds us in the moment that our bodies are how we navigate, explore and engage with the world. Wholehearted activists know we need to carefully support its health and resilience to prepare us to face all kinds of joys and challenges throughout our lives.

						<h1 id="moral">Moral Courage</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<blockquote>"Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity."<em>- W. Clement Stone</em>
							</blockquote>
							<p>This is the stuff that makes the social justice world go around. We know it when we see it and we know when it’s missing in action. Moral courage arises from how our internal integrity compass translates into our behaviour in the world. It is standing in our integrity and acting from our values, what we know to be right, even at the risk of our social status or tarnishing our “rep”. Even when it might be inconvenient, expose us to ridicule, punishment, and the wrath of others. Moral courage asks us to rise above cynicism, apathy, the false ‘us/them’, ‘wrong/right’ divides, intolerance, judgement, and our apparent differences, and what the world looks like today in order to envision what it could be. It calls our bluff every time we say we want a better world and we keep doing the same things over and over. It calls for daring honesty. It’s what we need to answer the summons of our purpose.</p>
<p>
Moral courage can take many forms: the whistleblower who risks job loss to expose wrongdoing by an employer. When we probe to understand the ‘why’ behind the what of a friend’s arguments instead of dismissing them as ‘wrong’. The CEO who dares to go against prevailing business wisdom in the name of social good. When we keep someone’s confidence. When we hold others accountable for their actions takes moral courage, of us and of them.
</p>
<p>
Moral courage is about leading from a place of honestly, authenticity, empathy, and compassion. It invites us to honour our intuition, align what we know to be true with how we live our lives. Moral courage pushes us to make conscious decisions about what kind of attitudes and behaviours reflect the highest versions of our selves and who we aspire to be, and which ones diminish us. It beckons us to engage our wild imagination, limitless creativity, and unabashed wonder in the service of building a more beautiful world and then doing what it takes to get there.
