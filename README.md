# The live sites are at http://moon.greenpeace.org
Hey! You hit a repo holding some prototypes and sites and stuff I'm building or built for Greenpeace. 

## What is this now?
I like to grab kickin' designs and remix them for my own projects. In this repo I remixed a custom Bootstrap 3.1 template from http://bootply.com and Photon by html5up.net. This repo is allowing us to break out of the PDF format, and webify the Greenpeace Brand.

Feel free to [reach out](http://twitter.com/epilepticrabbit) and offer help, give feedback or otherwise communicate your thoughts and desires.

## Remixes of HTML5 Up
### Courage uses Phantom
This repo uses a remixed version of Phantom and by HTML5 UP

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)
