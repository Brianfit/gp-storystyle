## What is this now?
Hey! You hit a repo holding an interactive Brand Guide we're starting to build for Greenpeace. We grabbed a custom Bootstrap 3.1 template from http://bootply.com and started remixing it. The content for this guide is currently stored in a PDF. This repo is allowing us to break out of the PDF format, and webify the Greenpeace Brand.

Stay tuned, we'll add more to the readme once this experiment gets underway.
