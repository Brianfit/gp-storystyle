## What is this now?
Hey! You hit a repo holding an interactive Brand Guide we're starting to build for Greenpeace. We grabbed a custom Bootstrap 3.1 template from http://bootply.com and started remixing it. The content for this guide is currently stored in a PDF. This repo is allowing us to break out of the PDF format, and webify the Greenpeace Brand.

Stay tuned, we'll add more to the readme once this experiment gets underway. Feel free to [reach out](http://twitter.com/epilepticrabbit) and offer help, give feedback or otherwise communicate your thoughts and desires.
