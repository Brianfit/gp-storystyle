## What is this now?
Hey! You hit a repo holding some prototypes and sites and stuff I'm building or built for Greenpeace. I like to grab kickin' designs and remix them for my own projects. In this repo I remixed a custom Bootstrap 3.1 template from http://bootply.com and Photon by html5up.net. This repo is allowing us to break out of the PDF format, and webify the Greenpeace Brand.

Feel free to [reach out](http://twitter.com/epilepticrabbit) and offer help, give feedback or otherwise communicate your thoughts and desires.

## Workshop in a Box
I'm loving this new approach, it is beautiful! This is my development repo for what will eventually show up at http://moon.greenpeace.org/workshopinabox/

##Branding Guide
Maybe I'll come back to this, but for now, I'm not sure I like what I started here...
