<h1>Welcome to the Greenpeace Story & Content Guide!</h1>
</div>
    <p>Margaret Mead famously said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has."
    </blockquote>

    <p>For decades, this belief has driven our small band of activists to shoulder the responsibility for changing the world.</p>

    <p>But today’s world is too interconnected, too beset by urgent challenges and evolving too quickly for us to continue to believe that our team, acting on behalf of our supporters, really can change the world alone. Our effectiveness will not be determined by how powerful Greenpeace can be but by how powerful we can inspire millions of citizens around the world to become.</p>

    <p>What does this mean for us practically? We will make regular, everyday people our heroes. It means that we will not create actions that make people feel like change is in the hands of the insanely committed few, rather we will help them see themselves as agents of change. We will stop thinking about “supporters” and “donors” and start thinking about millions of partners.</p>
    
    <p>Every communication we create and every action we take must reinforce this core insight. Our moral is what we stand for, our theory of change and our mantra.</p>

<h2>How to use this guide</h2>
    <p>The first time you view this Guide, please read through the Docs section. This will introduce you to our messaging strategy, values and voice. Understanding how we wish to present ourselves to the world will orient you to what’s behind the brand tools that follow, and make sure your work reinforces the brand we are building together.</p>

    <p>The Stories section documents the competing narratives our audiences are surrounded by every day. They have both informed the brand elements we’ve created and must feel present and accounted for in any external messaging created.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Planet 4 Style Guide</strong> will help us have visual consistency in our web communications. When all NROs and GPI integrate the basic common elements in <a href="http://moon.greenpeace.org/style-guide">this guide</a>, we strengthen our message and increase its effectiveness. International and national/regional office websites
should share enough common elements to be immediately identifiable as belonging to the same organisation.</p>

		<p>We think that <strong>the Arctic</strong> deserves to be protected for all life on earth. One of our greatest strengths is the simplicity and power of our message. Let’s communicate it clearly. <a href="https://savethearctic.org/styleguide/">Our visual style</a> should be simple, powerful and uncluttered. Let’s echo the clean lines and crystal beauty of the Arctic, but keep things playful, creative and human too.</p>
