<!-- TITLE AND SUMMARY -->
      <h1>Specialized Story Workshop: Greenpeace Canada</h1>
      <h2>This workshop was part of a wider team retreat that was aimed at creating a space for team building and as well as introducing the team to some new concepts and processes. With the team building objective in mind, we designed the story workshop to be interactive, engaging and playful with lots of opportunity for the team to work together in smaller groups and to be heard and seen by one another.</h2>

<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
        
        <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>While planning this workshop, we discussed 3 challenges <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/">Greenpeace Canada</a> was facing that we could potentially apply the lens of story to. We aimed to build the last two of these into the workshop.  
			 <div class="example-div">
				 <ul>
					 <li><strong>Legal challenge</strong>: Canada was being sued by a logging company for $7 million and needed to increase leverage over the next 7 months. From a story perspective, this has been challenging for the team as it’s been a tale of David and Goliath, which can sound self interested. We needed to try to tie it to a bigger story with more longevity.</li>
					 <li><strong>Election</strong>: Canada’s federal election was coming up. This was an important opportunity because people were disaffected with the current administration. It would tie together many areas of our work. We could use the election as an opportunity to tell a united story of what Greenpeace Canada is about.</li>
					 <li><strong>Arctic and Tar Sands</strong>: These are two big campaigns. <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/campaigns/Energy/tarsands/">Tar sands</a> is an oil extraction project that is one of the centerpieces of Canada’s economic growth plan and is a top political issue. The <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/campaigns/Energy/Arctic/">Arctic is a newer campaign</a>, not yet a big news story. The two are highly related. Canada needed help connecting the dots between these two campaigns. 
</p>
	<h2>Primary Objectives</h2>
	<p>The primary aim of the story workshop is to introduce team Canada to the new Greenpeace Story and the organisational shifts it implies (The Seven Shifts), and work with the group to help them think about what would mean for a new Greenpeace Canada. And to do this in a way that is engaging, fun and helps the group to bond and connect as a team. </p>
	<h2>Pre-work for the Workshop</h2>
	<p>We asked participants to think of one example of a story, a trend, an event, or an anecdote that gives them hope that a better world is possible. We asked them to reach beyond Greenpeace's work into things that are either changing, or have the potential to change, the fabric of the world or which are rerouting our future away from the status quo and toward a more beautiful, sustainable, greener, more peaceful world. We explained that we would be running an exercise in which we may ask participants to pitch their example in a ONE MINUTE, lightning-fast presentation of WHAT the example is and WHY it gives you hope. </p>

<!-- REVIEW & ASSESSMENT -->
        <h2>Assessment and review</h2>
        Practical tips for assessing learning:

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use the discussions in each exercise</strong>: Discussion and reflection are important components of learning. Ask questions like:
                            <ul>
                                <li>How can your work connect to the 7 Shifts and living the new story?</li>

                                <li>Why is it important to connect to global communities?</li>

                                <li>How does communication online differ from communication offline?</li>

                                <li>What excited you the most about this training? The least?</li>

								<li>How will we take what we've learned forward?</li>
								<li>What does it mean to live the story? </li> 
								<li>Where can we go for help?</li>
                            </ul>
                            
							<li><strong>Peer Assessment:</strong> Have people look at one another's work and give each other constructive feedback. Hold each other accountable for participation, and encourage open discussion with one another.</li>
							<li><strong>Share</strong>: Have you posted your work somewhere? Did you tweet with the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23courageis&src=typd">#courageis</a> hashtag? Have you attended a <a href="http://wiki.greenpeace.org/Engagement/Community/Calls">Story Community Call</a>?</li>
        </ul>

<!--Preparation-->
<h2>Preparation</h2>

                    <p>You need a large room that can comfortably fit all your participants in a circle. Small break out rooms are a plus.</p>

                    <p>It is also recommended to have a team of co-facilitators who can help shape and run the agenda with you. We recommend 1 facilitator to 5 participants.</p>

<!-- LEARNING OBJECTIVES -->
        <h2>Learning objectives</h2>
         <p>By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>share their learning with fellow Greenpeace peers and wider communities</li>

                        <li>identify the 7 Shifts and explain their individual intentions</li>
                        
                        <li>understand and explain to others how to live the 7 Shifts</li>
                        
                        <li>support Greenpeace in becoming more open</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The participants will understand that:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>they’re part of a global network and community that can help promote local initiatives</li>
                       
                        <li>they’re key ambassadors for Greenpeace, both online and in their communities</li>
                        
                        <li>facilitating and pacing the event is essential to sustaining participant engagement and energy levels</li>

                        <li>we have cultural notions of what learning is <em>supposed</em> to look like</li>

                        <li>modeling behavior we want to see in the world is an integral part of living the new story of Greenpeace</li>

                        <li>we can add the teaching and learning of the 7 Shifts into any campaign or topic</li>

                        <li>working openly means you release early and often to improve your own practice</li>

                        <li>living the new story intermingles social skills, technical skills and topical knowledge</li>

                        <li>being part of a community means you can improve your practice and help improve other’s as well</li>

                        <li>inviting people into your work is a good way to give them agency to contribute</li>
                    </ul>
