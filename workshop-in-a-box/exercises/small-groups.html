        <h1>Small Group Work</h1>
        <h2>When a particular group of workshop participants have multiple issues to problem solve, breaking into small groups is a great way to move thinking in a particular area forward. The real-world examples below (from a Greenpeace Story Workshop in Canada) show how small groups can address very different ideas and then share their solutions with a wider audience.

        <h1 class="big-green-title">Steps for the Activity</h1>
        For this activity youâ€™ll want to <strong>break the group into teams of 4-5 people</strong>.  This is an optimal number for group work. 
        <ol>
	        <li>
		       Select several themes or topics for groups to focus on:
				<div class="example-div">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Campaign focus</strong>: Ask a group to choose a campaign such as Canada's <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/campaigns/Energy/tarsands/">Tar Sands</a> or <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/campaigns/Energy/Arctic/">Arctic</a> campaigns. Focus the group to think about about how an approach to a specific opportunity, in Canada's case a national election, looks differently with the 7 shifts as a guide. Have people discuss what a radically positive story would look like. Have this group to hone in on 1 or 2 of <a href="../shifts.html">the shifts</a> (e.g. root causes/ dogmatic defender) to further focus their thinking.
</li>
						<li><strong>Regional or national focus</strong>Using <a href="grip.html">the Grip activity</a>, have a group focus on what is happening regionally or nationally that they could GRIP onto. Have the group focus on how they might use a cultural occurance to tell a different kind of story. You may also focus the group to focus on 1 or 2 of the shifts (e.g. supporters to change agents and fearing failure)</li>
						<li><strong>Internal culture focus</strong>: Assign one group to determine what "living the 7 shifts" would it mean for internal culture. Have them define how we can live and breathe it in the way we interact with each other, hire, run meetings etc. 
</li>
						<li><strong>Engagement focus</strong>: Have a group consider extending the supporter journey - what does our current interaction with supporters look like?  How might we turn this on its head and extend it?</li>
					</ul>
				</div>     
          </li>

          <li>Brief all participants on the 4 areas of focus.
          </li>
          <li>Allow participants to self select. If some groups are too large or too small, use your mighty facilitation powers and ask people to redistribute. 
</li>
					<li>Have teams write ideas up on a flip chart and be ready to present back to the other teams</li>
        </ol>

      </section>
      <section class="attention-section">
        <h1><i class="icon-comments"></i> Discussion</h1>
        <div>When briefing the activity the facilitator should emphasize that the only way we can create a record of their conversations is through great note taking. Let the groups develop their ideas and give each group 3 minutes to present back to the bigger group - try and tease out how these ideas feel different to what we normally do, whether they feel courageous and how they offer opportunities for people to engage in a meaningful way with Greenpeace.
