This one hour exercise helps us think about how we can harness the passion of our target audiences and inspire them to courageous action.

        For this activity you’ll want to <strong>break the group into teams of 4-5 people</strong>.  To brief the activity we have put together a bunch of examples of other organisations and Greenpeace campaigns that we think are doing this well - see the slide deck in the materials section. 
        
        <ol>
	        <li>
		       Select a key target audience to focus on
	        </li>
          <li>
          (20 mins) Using the diagram below brainstorm the following (DIAGRAM ON SLIDE 11 OF THE SLIDE DECK  - LINK IN THE  ‘MATERIALS’ SECTION): 
What does our audience feel passionately about?  Think as broadly, this could be anything from surfing, the growing vegetables to train spotting. It doesn’t need to be environmental. 
What challenges do they face in relation to your campaign or issue? 
What assets does Greenpeace have that we could use to create a different call to action i.e. people, ships, office space etc.

          </li>

          <li>(35 minutes) As a group discuss where you think the different activities you have written on your post its notes might sit. Here are some definitions to help you: 
          <div class="example-div">
	          <ul>
			  	<li><strong>Incremental:</strong> An activity that will create incremental change but wont push us in a fundamentally different direction</li>
			  	<li><strong>Disruptive:</strong> An initiative that is likely to create really change i.e. a marked change in the way we are working that pushes us firmly in the direction of one of the shifts</li>
			  	<li><strong>Game changing:</strong> Initiatives that change the rules of the game - they are likely to be radically people powered, system changing ideas</li>
	          </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
          <a href="images/graph-3buckets.png"><img src="images/graph-3buckets.png" width="100%"></a>
	     Some projects might not fit in any of them, and some buckets might be empty.  The important thing is to be really strict with yourselves about where you put things.  Think carefully about whether an activity really is game changing or is it’s actually achieving Incremental or Disruptive change
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>Take one of the initiatives that is in the Incremental pile and brainstorm ways in which you could make it disruptive or even game changing. </li>
        </ol>

        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="attention-section">
        <h1><i class="icon-comments"></i> Discussion</h1>
        <div>Allow the group to collectively agree where they think the different activities, past and present, sit across the buckets.  If everything is in the game changer bucket then challenge them on whether this really is the case.  Get them to be quite strict with themselves about this.  You might ask them to come up with an imaginary project that they think would be really game changing.
