This one hour exercise helps us think about how we can harness the passion of our target audiences and inspire them to courageous action. It helps us move beyond the realms of petitions and donations.

        For this activity you’ll want to <strong>break the group into teams of 4-5 people</strong>.  To brief the activity we have put together a bunch of examples of other organisations and Greenpeace campaigns that we think are doing this well - see the slide deck in the materials section. 
        
        <ol>
	        <li>
		       Select a key target audience to focus on
	        </li>
          <li>
          (20 mins) Using the diagram below brainstorm the following: 
          <img src="images/venn-courage-asks.png" width="100%">
				<div class="example-div">
					<ul>
						<li>What does our audience feel passionately about?  Think as broadly, this could be anything from surfing, the growing vegetables to train spotting. It doesn’t need to be environmental. </li>
						<li>What challenges do they face in relation to your campaign or issue?</li>
						<li>What assets does Greenpeace have that we could use to create a different call to action i.e. people, ships, office space etc. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>     
          </li>

          <li>(10 mins) come up with as many ideas as you can that combine things from your three lists
          </li>
          <li>(15 mins) Choose your top two to develop further and use the questions below to push your ideas: 
		  	<div class="example-div">
					<ul>
						<li>How could we make it radically optimistic? </li>
						<li>How could we make our audience want to come to us instead of chasing them? 
Does it take us to the edge of our comfort zone?  If not, what would? 
</li>
					<li>Write your ideas up on a flip chart and be ready to present back to the other teams</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="attention-section">
        <h1><i class="icon-comments"></i> Discussion</h1>
        <div>When briefing the activity the facilitator should emphasise that this is about coming up with engagement opportunities that connect with what people are passionate about and go above and beyond the world of petitions and donations.  Use the examples in the slides for inspiration.  Let the groups develop their ideas and give each group 3 minutes to present back to the bigger group - try and tease out how these ideas feel different to what we normally do, whether they feel courageous and how they offer opportunities for people to engage in a meaningful way with Greenpeace.
