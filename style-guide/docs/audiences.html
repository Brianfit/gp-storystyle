<h2>We Are the Champions of the Impossible</h2>
	    <p>The stories we live by, often without even knowing they exist, define for each of us our sense of what’s possible and what’s not.</p>
	    <p>Today’s stories tell us to dream small, keep safe and to constantly strive for shiny but meaningless tokens because our real aspirations, those childhood dreams of slaying dragons — well, they’re for children.</p>
		<p>With this limited view of what’s possible, the future for those who dare consider it, is a dreary place indeed. Full of the invincible dragons of climate change, a dying planet, human greed. And the only logical thing to do is turn
away.</p>
	<p><strong>But we have a different view. We are the Champions of the Impossible. And we smash culture’s debilitating stories, challenging our heroes to rethink possible.</strong></p>
	<p>From our original naïve-seeming adventure into a nuclear test zone that rocked the world’s consciousness to our
takedowns of billion dollar corporate polluters we’ve never listened to anyone else’s definition of what can be.
We’ve never believed that humans are inherently bad or that one person’s actions can’t spark a million more.</p>
	<p>Now, to save the world, we’re going to get a billion other people to smash their own impossibles.</p>
	<p>We will tell stories using language that is optimistic, bold and includes a humorous wink. We will rebel against convention and make beauty in the face of dreary and stale.</p>

<h2>Courageous Citizens Everywhere</h2>
The world we aspire to will not be created by a single organisation or by a handful of professional activists. Change depends on the individual and coordinated actions of millions. The true heroes of our story are the citizens we inspire to action.

<p>insert persona work</p>

<h2>Greenpeace Activists</h2>
<p>Inspiring courageous action takes role models willing to put themselves on the line
on behalf of the planet. Greenpeace activists are the “heroes among heroes.” They are role models who fortify people’s belief that one courageous act can be contagious and that people really can change the world.</p>
<p>Greenpeace staff are just like our Courageous Citizen heroes. They just happen to make courageous action their full time gig. In practical terms, this means that Greenpeace staff should not be shown as superhuman daredevils with a drive to do what everyday people could never do. We’re past the era of “give us money and we’ll save the world.” And if stories of Greenpeace activists make Courageous Citizens say “I could never do that” too many times, we won’t inspire a billion acts.</p>
<p>Instead, Greenpeace Activists should be shown as human. They are Change Leaders and Culture Shapers. They are adventurers, artists, hackers and engineers. They are mothers, fathers, athletes, retail clerks, baristas, farmers, welders. They are concerned but hopeful. They are capable of outrage but also of love. They are driven by a vision of a far better world.</p>
