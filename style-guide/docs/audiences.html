            <h2>We Are Heroes Among Heroes</h2>

            <p>The stories we live by, often without even knowing they exist, define for each of us our sense of what’s possible and what’s not.</p>

            <p>Today’s stories tell us to dream small, keep safe and to constantly strive for shiny but meaningless tokens because our real aspirations, those childhood dreams of slaying dragons — well, they’re for children.</p>

            <p>With this limited view of what’s possible, the future for those who dare consider it, is a dreary place indeed. Full of the invincible dragons of climate change, a dying planet, human greed. And the only logical thing to do is turn away.</p>

            <p><strong>But we have a different view. We are the Champions of the Impossible. And we smash culture’s debilitating stories, challenging our heroes to rethink possible.</strong></p>

            <p>From our original naïve-seeming adventure into a nuclear test zone that rocked the world’s consciousness to our takedowns of billion dollar corporate polluters we’ve never listened to anyone else’s definition of what can be. We’ve never believed that humans are inherently bad or that one person’s actions can’t spark a million more.</p>

            <p>Now, to save the world, we’re going to get a billion other people to smash their own impossibles.</p>

            <p>We will tell stories using language that is optimistic, bold and includes a humorous wink. We will rebel against convention and make beauty in the face of dreary and stale.</p>

            <h3>Courageous Citizens Everywhere</h3>

            <p>The world we aspire to will not be created by a single organisation or by a handful of professional activists. Change depends on the individual and coordinated actions of millions. The true heroes of our story are the citizens we inspire to action.</p>

            <p>They are inspired, angered, irrepressible, unconforming and in love with life. Like everyone else, those who embrace their power and responsibility as citizens feel fear — fear of speaking out, fear of failure and fear of belief in the future. But our citizen-heroes face their fears because they have learned that life begins at the edge of their comfort zones. And they know that anything worth doing takes courage.</p>

            <p>We will remind our citizen-heroes of the problems of the world. But we will leave behind the tired notion that we can motivate them only through fear. We’re not going to change the world with frightened petition signers. To win, we need to embolden these citizens to commit their acts of courage — acts that will ripple through their communities and encourage countless more. We need to make them believe a better world is possible.</p>

 <h3>Greenpeace Activists</h3>

            <p>Inspiring courageous action takes role models willing to put themselves on the line on behalf of the planet. Greenpeace activists are the "heroes among heroes." They are role models who fortify people’s belief that one courageous act can be contagious and that people really can change the world.</p>

            <p>Greenpeace staff are just like our Courageous Citizen heroes. They just happen to make courageous action their full time gig. In practical terms, this means that Greenpeace staff should not be shown as superhuman daredevils with a drive to do what everyday people could never do. We’re past the era of “give us money and we’ll save the world.” And if stories of Greenpeace activists make Courageous Citizens say “I could never do that” too many times, we won’t inspire a billion acts.</p>

            <p>Instead, Greenpeace Activists should be shown as human. They are Change Leaders and Culture Shapers. They are adventurers, artists, hackers and engineers. They are mothers, fathers, athletes, retail clerks, baristas, farmers, welders. They are concerned but hopeful. They are capable of outrage but also of love. They are driven by a vision of a far better world.</p>

            <h3>Other NGOs</h3>

            <p>Decades from now, nobody will look back and say that "The Greenpeace Revolution" changed the course of history. They will point to a networked movement of many organizations and, more importantly, millions of people acting for a thriving future.</p>

            <p>In our story world, other NGOs are our fellow travellers, each bringing their unique skills and assets to the table. We celebrate their efforts, offer support in real time and expect support for our work in return. We train activists who work under other banners in the art of courageous action.</p>

            <p>Sure there are other NGOs who work for the dark side. But they rarely appear in our story. Our story universe is populated with organisations working with us in joint purpose to form a global movement.</p>

            <h3>Corporations</h3>

            <p>Corporations can wear the masks of friendly or edgy or sexy individuals. They appear in our lives as friends, confidants, role models. The people who work for them may be all of these things. But the corporations themselves have been enabled to grow so powerful that it’s no longer clear if they serve us (as we intended), or if we now serve them.We may occasionally find ways to enlist corporations as allies as they pursue their self-interest, or seek to be the culture change levers that move us towards the more beautiful world we see. But whatever their motives, we must remind our citizen-heroes that corporations do not belong in our governments, political processes and personal lives, and that Profit as a bottom line is far from adequate if People and Planet do not feature prominently. We must remind them that there is a legion of change makers ready, willing and able to reorient them to greater service should they forget.</p>

            <h3>Governmental Leaders</h3>

            <p>Governmental leaders are too often beholden to special interests and corporations or just downright corrupt. In the democratic world, these leaders are the products of a civil society that has too long ceded its power.</p>

            <p>Our leaders have utterly failed to act to protect our climate, stop biodiversity loss and ensure civil liberties because the pressures on them from the forces of destruction have been so much more powerful than the pressure from the forces of good. That’s changing. Our heroes have shown what social media can do to tyranny and what people-powered movements can do to shock incumbents. Our leaders fear their elite masters, but they will come to respect the courageous voices of millions even more.</p>

            <p>Among this crowd of mostly tired puppets and oppressive dictators, we find glimmers of hope. Some of our own, citizenheroes, have risen to the halls of power. We will celebrate these few and make sure more like them succeed.</p>

            <h3>Our Imagined Critics</h3>

            <p>Climate deniers. Pessimistic fatalists. Those who insist people are too lazy to be anything but passive consumers. Those who say Greenpeace can never change. The purists who say that if we’re not perfect, we’re worthless.</p>

            <p>Sure, these characters exist in the world, but it’s time to stop giving them so much oxygen. The best way to kill an idea is to view it through the lens of the worst-case-scenario narrated in the voice of your worst critics. Our imagined critics will not occupy space in our story universe.</p>

            <p>When crafting campaigns and communications, imagining the objections from the minority, or those we’ll never be able to engage anyway, decreases our penchant for courageous action. We don’t need everybody in the world on board. One billion acts is an ambitious goal that only takes a small slice of the global population. Our story is for those alive and well enough to say “count me in.” It is not meant to re-awaken the dead.</p>
