    <h2>We're all natural storytellers.</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Good Communications is Storytelling</strong>: Stories are how we make sense of the world. They shape peoples’ behaviour and their belief in what’s possible.</li>

        <li><strong>Storytelling is also a path to change</strong>: The story Greenpeace tells, and has always told, is that a better world is possible, and brave individual and collective actions can make it a reality.</li>

        <li><strong>The moral of our organisational story</strong>: Every Greenpeace campaign &amp; every Greenpeace action can be boiled down to this – <strong>a billion acts of courage can spark a better tomorrow.</strong></li>
    </ul>

            <h3>You are what you own.</h3>

            <p>We are consumers, not citizens. Someone else makes the big decisions while we define ourselves by the stuff we have, the stuff we want to buy and the stuff we wouldn’t be caught dead with. More money will make us more fulfilled. And the best way to express our values is by "voting with our dollars."</p>

            <p>Of course, there are billions who own nothing and thus are worth nothing according to this myth. We would need many more planets to include everyone in this crumbling story.</p>

            <h3>You are what you contribute.</h3>

            <p>Our creativity, our passions and our willingness to help others defines us. We identify ourselves by the ideas we come up with, the ideas of others we pass on and share and the acts we are bold enough to take. We don’t consume the coolest stuff, we create it. And happiness comes less from having than it does from sharing.</p>

            <p><strong>The new story is a reality</strong> Maker culture is growing rapidly. Open Source development is leading Internet evolution. There is increased interest in redefining "the good life." 3D printing is set to disrupt manufacturing in the same way mp3s disrupted music. Old gatekeepers (media companies, governments and pundits) are losing control.</p>

            <h3>Economic growth is good.</h3>

            <p>Our well-being relies on an ever-growing economy. Though many of us have come to suspect that economic growth accelerates the consumption of Earth’s natural resources and enriches the global 1%, we’re still dependent on the opportunities and wealth it spreads around.</p>

            <h3>Wealth means healthy people and a healthy planet.</h3>

            <p>Our economy exists to serve people, not the other way around. Real wealth derives not from numbers on a stock ticker but on the health of the planet on which we all depend. Progress is defined by how many are lifted out of poverty and by shrinking inequality. People created the old measures of economic health — so people can create new ones.</p>

            <p><strong>The new story is a reality</strong> The widely predicted slowing of global growth within the next two decades is based on demographic and resource trends. Including: growing distrust in unbridled capitalism (evidence by broad public opinion polls); near consensus about the threat of climate change; and new measures of economic well-being are taking hold.</p>

            <h3>Military power is safety.</h3>

            <p>The world is a dangerous place and the only way to protect ourselves is to spend billions on high-tech weaponry, constant surveillance and occasional but consistent invasions of non-compliant countries.</p>

            <h3>Empathy and equality keep us strong and safe.</h3>

            <p>There will never be enough tanks and spies to secure a world in which billions live in desperate circumstances — while billions more move in that direction thanks to environmental degradation. Terrorism and aggression rely on the fuel of injustice. It is far more effective to fight back with mutual support, opportunity and empathy born of the interconnection that has now become possible.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p><strong>The new story is a reality</strong> Terrorism and cyber threats cannot be confronted with military might. New technologies make empathy at scale suddenly possible. Young people are increasingly rejecting homophobia, sexism, racism and nationalism.

            <h3>Technology will solve all the problems humanity creates.</h3>

            <p>Scientists are working hard on solutions that will allow us to keep living just as we do. Someone will find a way to take the carbon out of the air, rebuild the coral reefs, regrow the forests and deal with all our garbage. When the market demands these things, they will simply appear.</p>

            <p>Human ingenuity is indeed capable of amazing things. But it only solves the problems that it’s applied to. It is up to all of us to direct that ingenuity to take on our world’s most pressing challenges, starting now. And that ingenuity is needed not just from the elite inventors of the world, but from parents, educators, communities — all of us.</p>

            <p>We live in a world where good ideas can cross the globe in seconds, building millions of supporters along the way. Our actions can be noticed by anyone, anywhere. And while our leaders will need to be part of the solution, it has become clear that we, the people, will lead and leaders will follow.</p>

Twitter toppling tyranny. Hackers inventing faster than corporations.</p>

            <h3>Humans are bad.</h3>

            <p>It’s an idea that’s been spread since the Bible’s story of The Garden of Eden. Humans have stepped outside of nature’s order and now exist apart from it. We are perverse and mean, incapable of sustained cooperation and altruism. Now that we’ve attained mastery over the Earth, any hope that we will leave behind greed and violence in time are fantasies of the naive.</p>

            <h3>We are evolving just in time.</h3>

            <p>Yes, we’ve shown our capacity for selfishness and short-sightedness. But humans have also been capable of enormous courage, altruism and evolution. Just as our problems accelerate, so too has our ability to understand each other, to collaborate on solutions and to influence the power structures that have limited us. These abilities are scaling exponentially. Fatalism about the future shows a very limited view of human potential.</p>

    <h2>Create a myth gap for your campaign</h2>

    <p>The crumbling stories above are far from comprehensive of all those we might address — and over time, new core stories will be called into question. The myths presented represent a starting place, but individual campaigns may use this format to identify and address others.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>To do this, begin by thinking about your target audience. What stories and attitudes offer them meaning, explanation about how their world works and rituals to live by? Capture one of these stories in a headline.</li>

        <li>Now look for trend reports, pieces of pop culture or news events that call that story into question. Don’t worry if the myth hasn’t been 100% debunked. The idea is not to find stories that are truly dead. Nobody cares about those. What you’re looking for is the open space between the old way of thinking and something new. This is where most great persuasion campaigns find their power.</li>

        <li>It’s not enough to point out what’s wrong with the old way. Calling an old story into question only gets people excited if you offer something to replace it with. New stories don’t just appear out of thin air. They are produced over time by many cultural forces working together. So new stories we seek to spread shouldn’t be born out of our own heads. We must look outward to find stories that are taking hold and that we can help amplify with our campaigns. Again, trend reports, pop culture and current events make fertile ground for discovering new stories to amplify.</li>
    </ol>
