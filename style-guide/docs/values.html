        <p>Successful organizations evolve from a set of core values. They drive and prioritize activities that align with those values. From culture to relationships, brands can provide benefits to their audiences by identifying shared values. There are two types of values: those that we inspire in our audiences and those that we use to operate our organisation.</p>

            <h3>Courage</h3>

            <p>We believe: Life starts at the edge of your comfort zone and that the future is waiting for us to speak up.</p>

            <p>So: We call on everyone to bravely stand up for what they believe in and to take action for a better world.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Connectivity</h3>

            <p>We believe: Everyone holds a piece of a better world and that the antidote to organised money is organised people.</p>

            <p>So: We embrace a diversity of visions, catalyse collaboration and encourage the exploration of new ideas and possibilities.</p>

            <h3>Hope</h3>

            <p>We believe: The positivity of action is better than cynicism and despair.</p>

            <p>So: We will get up off the sofa and express ourselves through our actions, knowing that our example inspires hope and action in others.</p>

        <h2>The values by which we operate</h2>

        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <h4>Personal Responsibility & Nonviolence</h4>

            <p>We take personal responsibility for our actions, and we are committed to nonviolence. These principles are inspired by the Quaker concept of ‘bearing witness,’ which is about taking action based on conscience – personal action based on personal responsibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <h4>Independence</h4>

            <p>We ensure our financial independence from political or commercial interests. We do not accept money from either companies or governments. And we mean any money. Individual contributions, together with foundation grants, are the only source of our funding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <h4>No Permanent Friends or Foes</h4>

            <p>In exposing threats to the environment and finding solutions we have no permanent allies or adversaries. If your government or company is willing to change, we will work with you to achieve your aims. Dither, backtrack or turn around and we will be back.</p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="col-sm-3">
            <h4>Promoting Solutions</h4>

            <p>We seek solutions for, and promote open, informed debate about society’s environmental choices. We don’t work to manage environmental problems, we work to eliminate them. It’s not enough for us to point the finger; we develop, research and promote concrete steps towards a green and peaceful future for all of us.</p>

        <h1>Our Role</h1>

        <p>To function as mentors to our heroes — and to truly be Champions of the Impossible — we will play a very specific role in this story.</p>

        <p>Our job going forward is to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>EXPAND POSSIBLE</strong> — We will lead by example with our own heroic acts: adding real value to the broader movement by doing those things that no one else can, breaking new ground, and pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable or seen as possible.</li>

            <li><strong>INSPIRE ACTION</strong> — We will debunk the myth that courage is for the lucky few and provide specific tools, events and relationships that give people a deeper belief in their ability to go outside their comfort zones (see Brand Gift section for more details).</li>

            <li><strong>PROVIDE A PATH</strong> — We will share our skills, such as non-violent direct action and strategic thinking; and provide meaningful ways for people to take action as part of our campaigns, leveraging their unique skills and encouraging them to dream big.</li>

            <li><strong>CATALYSE</strong>— Diversity is strength, so we will embrace a symphony of visions, catalyse collaboration between unlikely partners, and encourage the exploration of new ideas and possibilities, helping to redirect our unlimited ingenuity as humans toward the creation of a better world.</li>

            <li><strong>AMPLIFY</strong> — Every time people experience something that doesn’t fit with an old story, it weakens it, disrupts it, and makes space for something new. We’ll lend our reputation, name and energy to repeat and celebrate stories of contagious courage from inside our own network and beyond; from our local environment to the other side of the world; knowing that these stories have the power to inspire hope, courage and action in others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>What we offer</h1>

        <p>Greenpeace will offer actions, trainings and communications that help millions systematically build their courage muscles.</p>

        <h2>We will do this by providing people with:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>PURPOSE</strong> – A bigger story that gives reason to believe my action will matter</li>

            <li><strong>ROLE MODELS</strong> – Examples of courageous heroes – succeeding and failing</li>

            <li><strong>SOCIAL PROOF</strong> – A community to connect to online and through events so people don’t feel alone</li>

            <li><strong>SKILLS</strong> – Practical tools to help build the courage muscle</li>

            <li><strong>A TRIGGER</strong> – Specific calls to courageous action</li>
        </ul>
