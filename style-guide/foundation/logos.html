    <h2>The Greenpeace Logo</h2>

    <p>When Greenpeace International was set up in the late 1970s there was one item that kept appearing on the agenda of every annual planning meeting: finding a common logo. In those days, there was no agreed way to write (or even capitalise) "Greenpeace." Some adopted a Native American symbol while others used a peace sign and the ecology icon with "Green Peace" as two words. Some wrote "Greenpeace" in a Times-Roman font, and others would use whatever typeface they fancied that week - often depending on which Letraset sheets were lying around the office or ship. Whenever the logo came up for discussion, it would either lead to an argument based on personal preferences or get overlooked in favour of more important campaign matters.</p> 
    <p>Rémi Parmentier, one of the founders of Greenpeace International, recalls 
	    <blockquote>One day in Paris in the early 80s, we were out of Letraset sheets and the local stationery shop was closed. A publication needed a Greenpeace logo. So a fellow named Jean- Marc Pias, who had been making posters and stickers, ran around the corner to a bar and asked an artist friend named Patrick Garaude to write out "Greenpeace" for him.</blockquote> 
	   Garaude drew quickly with a fat felt-tip pen, on a beer mat, and the "graffiti logo" was born. It was adopted by office after office and ship after ship until it became one of the most recognised symbols in the world. Rémi says: 
	   <blockquote>Whenever I see that logo today, especially in remote places like Antarctica and the Amazon, I remember Garaude with a pen in one hand, and a beer in the other.</blockquote></p>

                <li><strong>Variations</strong> Please do reproduce the logo from master artwork. Please don't redraw or alter the logo.</li>

                <li><strong>Minimum size</strong> Please make sure the logo is not smaller than 30mm (85px). This should only be used where space is limited.</li>

                <li><strong>Spacing</strong> Please do allow the logo some space to breath. A good rule of thumb is to make sure nothing else intercepts the space around the logo equal to half the height of the logo. E.g. Spacing should be at least 15mm all the way around.</li>

                <li><strong>Shape</strong> Well-known international logos rely on their shape rather than their lettering for recognition. They become symbols rather than written words. Altering the shape can confuse people, especially non-native English speakers.</li>
